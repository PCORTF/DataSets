# DataSets
## Utilization
This table was created to allow for our .csv file to be searchable, filterable, and generally more accessible than a traditional .csv file. 
## References
Based on work by [David Eder](https://github.com/derekeder/csv-to-html-table). All instructions for implementation of the table can be found here. 
## Notes
- All data in this table is publicly available, with few resources requiring a license. 
- Material is subject change.
- This file is used as a proof of concept and will not be the final version of the document.
